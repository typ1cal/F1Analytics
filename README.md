Formula 1 Data Analysis with Azure by Yash Wadhawe
This project focuses on analyzing Formula 1 race data to gain insights into team and driver performance and develop predictive models for future races. I am using Azure services such as Azure Blob Storage, Azure Databricks, and Azure Machine Learning to collect, store, analyze, and visualize data from the Kaggle Formula 1 dataset. This project is a part of Final Project Assignment for the course IST615 - Cloud Management
